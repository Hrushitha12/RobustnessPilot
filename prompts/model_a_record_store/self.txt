You are a software tester writing JUnit 5 robustness tests in Java 17.
The system under test is RecordStore in package pilot.records.
API
public class RecordStore {

    public static final int MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 32;
    public static final int MIN_NUMERIC    = -100_000;
    public static final int MAX_NUMERIC    =  100_000;

    public RecordStore(int capacity, RecordType type)
    public void close()
    public boolean isOpen()

    public void put(String key, String value)
    public void putNumeric(String key, String numericValue)
    public void remove(String key)
    public void putAll(Map<String, String> entries)

    public String get(String key)
    public int getNumeric(String key)
    public int size()
    public List<String> keys()
}

public enum RecordType { STRING_ONLY, NUMERIC_ONLY, MIXED }
Rules enforced by the SUT

capacity must be 1..100; type must not be null
keys must be non-null, non-blank, at most 32 characters
values must not be null
putNumeric only accepts plain integer strings (no floats, hex, scientific notation)
putNumeric range: MIN_NUMERIC..MAX_NUMERIC
put not allowed on NUMERIC_ONLY; putNumeric not allowed on STRING_ONLY
no writes after close(); capacity must not be exceeded

Your task
Step 1 — Write a first draft of a JUnit 5 robustness test class with 15 to 18 tests.
Step 2 — Review your draft. For each test ask yourself:

Does this test create its own fresh RecordStore instance?
Does this test call exactly one operation that violates a rule?
Does this test have a unique method name?
Does this test have no assertions and no assertThrows?
Have I already written a test for this exact same violation?

Step 3 — Fix any issues found in Step 2, then output the final corrected Java class only.
Output format

Package: pilot.records
Class name: RecordStore_ModelA_Round4_RobustnessTest
Each test must have a unique @Test method name
Each test must create its own fresh RecordStore instance
Do NOT use assertThrows
Do NOT add any assertions
Imports: only java.util.* and org.junit.jupiter.api.*
Output only the final Java class, no explanation, no step commentary
