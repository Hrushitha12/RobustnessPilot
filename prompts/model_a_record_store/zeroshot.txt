You are a software tester writing JUnit 5 robustness tests in Java 17.
The system under test is a class called RecordStore in package pilot.records.
It is a typed, bounded, in-memory key-value store with the following API:
public class RecordStore {

    public static final int MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 32;
    public static final int MIN_NUMERIC    = -100_000;
    public static final int MAX_NUMERIC    =  100_000;

    public RecordStore(int capacity, RecordType type)
    public void close()
    public boolean isOpen()

    public void put(String key, String value)
    public void putNumeric(String key, String numericValue)
    public void remove(String key)
    public void putAll(Map<String, String> entries)

    public String get(String key)
    public int getNumeric(String key)
    public int size()
    public List<String> keys()
}

public enum RecordType { STRING_ONLY, NUMERIC_ONLY, MIXED }
Rules enforced by the SUT:

capacity must be between 1 and 100
type must not be null
keys must be non-null, non-blank, and at most 32 characters
values must not be null
putNumeric parses numericValue as a plain integer; rejects floats, hex, scientific notation, blank strings
putNumeric only accepts values between MIN_NUMERIC and MAX_NUMERIC
put is not allowed on NUMERIC_ONLY stores
putNumeric is not allowed on STRING_ONLY stores
no writes are allowed after close() is called

Write a JUnit 5 test class with 15 to 18 robustness tests.
Requirements:

Package: pilot.records
Class name: RecordStore_ModelA_Round1_RobustnessTest
Each test method must have a unique name
Each test must create its own RecordStore instance
Do not use assertThrows — just call the method and let exceptions propagate
Do not add any assertions — the test either survives or it does not
Import only from java.util and org.junit.jupiter.api
Output only the Java class, no explanation
